# Enumerable methods

This proyect has as a goal the recreation of some of the methods provided by the [Enumerable](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/Enumerable.html) module. Project instructions are in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/advanced-building-blocks#project-2-enumerable-methods).

## Methods provided

For every method emulated, just **prepend** `my_` to each of them, i.e, `my_each` would be the recreated version of the original `each`. The following is a list of the methods written from scratch with Ruby.

 - [x] `each`
 - [x] `each_with_index`
 - [x] `select`
 - [x] `all?`
 - [x] `any?`
 - [x] `none?`
 - [x] `count`
 - [x] `map`
 - [x] `inject`

## How to setup and test the methods

1. `git clone https://github.com/santiago-rodrig/enumerable.git`
2. `cd enumerable`
3. `irb`

Once inside the _interactive ruby_ (`irb`) program, load the ruby file `enumerable.rb`.

4. `load 'enumerable.rb'`

Test the recreated methods.
